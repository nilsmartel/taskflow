# TaskFlow - Flutter Task Manager

**Experimental Project:** Testing AI Assistance in App Development

The app is a simple task manager / todo app built with Flutter

## The Experiment

This project was created with significant AI assistance, serving as a test case for understanding both the benefits and limitations of AI in app development.

## Observed AI Limitations:
- **Over-engineering**: AI tends to introduce unnecessary complexity
- **Error-prone**: Generated code compiles after minor tweaks, yet contains subtle bugs
- **Maintenance challenges**: Difficult to maintain overview of AI-generated structures
- **Debugging issues**: When problems occur, AI struggles to provide effective solutions

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned About AI Assistance

- **Use AI sparingly**: For isolated components, not entire apps
- **Maintain simplicity**: Actively resist AI's complexity bias
